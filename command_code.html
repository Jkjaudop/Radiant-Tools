"Fix Hard Touch"

1. Reduce Touchscreen Tap Timeout

This can help if hard touch is related to delay in registering touches:

Command:
settings put secure long_press_timeout 300

(Default is 500ms; lower means quicker response to touch)

2. Try Lowering Touch Slop

Touch slop is the distance in pixels a touch can wander before being considered a scroll.

Command:
settings put system touch_slop 8

(Default is usually 16 or 8; lower = more sensitive)
